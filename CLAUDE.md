user = User.find_by(email: "user@example.com")
user.subscription.update!(status: "premium")
```

### Email Testing
```ruby
# Send test email
UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_later

# Preview emails in development
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers
```

### Sidekiq Jobs
```ruby
# Run a job manually
EmailJob.perform_async(user.id, "welcome")

# Clear all jobs
Sidekiq::Queue.all.each(&:clear)
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Controllers
- Use strong parameters
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Use before_action filters for common operations
- Keep controllers thin, move logic to models/services

### Models
- Use validations for data integrity
- Implement scopes for common queries
- Use callbacks sparingly
- Add indexes for foreign keys and commonly queried fields

### Views
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Implement Turbo frames for dynamic updates
- Use partials for reusable components
- Keep logic out of views

### Background Jobs
- Make jobs idempotent
- Use perform_async for non-critical tasks
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep jobs focused on single responsibilities

## Testing Approach

```ruby
# User registration flow test
RSpec.describe "User Registration", type: :system do
  it "allows user to sign up" do
    visit new_user_registration_path
    fill_in "Email", with: "newuser@example.com"
    fill_in "Password", with: "password123"
    fill_in "Password confirmation", with: "password123"
    click_button "Sign up"
    
    expect(page).to have_content("Welcome! Please check your email")
    expect(User.last.email).to eq("newuser@example.com")
  end
end
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Emails not sending in development
**Solution**: Check letter_opener is configured and visit http://localhost:3000/letter_opener

### Issue: Sidekiq jobs not processing
**Solution**: Ensure Redis is running and Sidekiq is started with `bundle exec sidekiq`

### Issue: Stripe webhooks failing
**Solution**: Use Stripe CLI for local testing: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/stripe/webhooks`

## Deployment Checklist

1. Set all environment variables on Heroku
2. Run database migrations: `heroku run rails db:migrate`
3. Compile assets: `rails assets:precompile`
4. Scale worker dyno: `heroku ps:scale worker=1`
5. Configure SendGrid addon
6. Set up Heroku Scheduler for periodic tasks
7. Configure SSL certificate
8. Set up error monitoring (Honeybadger/Sentry)

## Future Implementation Notes

### Enabling Paid Tiers
1. Remove blocking logic in `SubscriptionsController`
2. Implement Stripe checkout flow
3. Set up proper webhook handling
4. Add subscription management UI
5. Implement tier-based feature flags

### Adding File Uploads
1. Configure Active Storage
2. Set up S3 bucket and credentials
3. Implement file upload UI
4. Add file type validations
5. Implement virus scanning

### Multi-tenancy
1. Add Organization model
2. Implement subdomain routing
3. Scope all resources by organization
4. Add team invitation system
5. Implement role-based permissions

## Additional Context

- The project prioritizes simplicity and maintainability
- All paid features are intentionally disabled but ready to activate
- The admin panel is separate from the main user system
- Soft delete is implemented for GDPR compliance
- The system is designed to scale horizontally on Heroku
